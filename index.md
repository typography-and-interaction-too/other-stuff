# Stuff we didn’t get to!

[CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) (*custom properties*) help make modular, adjustable *design systems*.

> CSS variables are *set*/*declared* with a `--name: value;` syntax.
>
> They are *accessed*/*referenced* with `var(--name)`, wherever you would use a CSS *value*—colors, lengths, fonts, anything.
>
> You can also have a *fallback* value that will be used, `var(--name, fallback)`, if the variable doesn’t exist!

> Variables can be *set*/*declared* at any DOM level.

> Their value is set for all of the descendants of that element.
>
> The variables are not visible to siblings.
