## Easier text formatting

Jekyll uses [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) for marking… up text. It has a special *syntax* that is *parsed* into basic HTML, instead of manually writing it all out by hand.

It’s used by *many, many* things now: [Google chats](https://support.google.com/chat/answer/7649118?hl=en), [Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/markdown), [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), [Are.na](https://support.are.na/help/what-types-of-content-can-i-save-to-are-dot-na), [Notion](https://www.notion.so/help/writing-and-editing-basics), etc. Sometimes they have their own *flavors* that add special syntax, but the base stuff is the same. Often [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) text editors are just adding Markdown syntax around things!

* It’s **much easier** to read the source.
* It is usually much quicker to write.
* Your changes (Git’s `diff`) are clear.
* And overall it is less error-prone.

…than writing all the elements/tags yourself! Markdown does have to be compiled/parsed out into HTML, but a lot of software does this behind the scenes.

> I *love* Markdown. If there is only one thing you take away from our class, let it be some fluency in `.md`. It’s the [lingua franca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca) for basic text formatting.
